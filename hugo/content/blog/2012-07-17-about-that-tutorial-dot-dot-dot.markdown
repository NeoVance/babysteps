One thing I didn't make clear regarding my last post: I am not
especially satisfied with the way the "tutorial" was turning out.  I
use scare quotes here because I think it resembles a reference manual
more than a tutorial.  Nonetheless I think there are some sections
that are quite good; and a document like it probably ought to
exist. So I figured I'd post it anyhow and I can mine it for material
later.  I intend to start afresh however with something that dives at
the core ideas, which I think are relatively simple.
